We aim to study the association of genetically predicted plasma levels of the aging/rejuvenating proteins discovered in mice with brain aging features to test the hypothesis that human individuals that have an increased plasma level of the aging/rejuvenating factors discovered in mice may also have a brain that is aged or rejuvenated with respect to their chronological age.
